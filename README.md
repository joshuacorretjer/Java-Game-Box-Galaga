# Java Game Box: Galaga

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop Java Game Box: Galaga a simplified version of the
game of the century Galaga. This project will be worked in teams of two students. Your partner
must be different for each of the three projects. You should start by studying the application’s
architecture in the base code and learn how to efficiently modify the project to comply with the
minimal requirements. For full credit your team must develop these new features reusing as
little code as possible, avoiding code redundancy and duplication, following the project’s
structure and making the least changes possible.

## Minimal Requirements

Your application must comply with the following requirements:

• Phase 1 (WarmUp): Implement additional minor features.

- Galaga has multiple colored dots that appear and disappear in the background, the
  colors are blue, yellow, green and red. Add the colors white and magenta.

- Change the color of the grey background behind Galaga to be light blue

- Change the color of the text written in the game to Magenta.

• Phase 2: Debugging Commands:

- Implement the keyboard button ‘N’ so that when pressed the character dies.

- Implement the keyboard button ‘M’ so that when pressed the character is given
another life (unless the lives are already full).

- Implement the keyboard button ‘P’ so that the game spawns a bee enemy into a
random unoccupied position in the formation [has to be one of the spots allowed to
the bee enemy stated in the comments in code defined by rows and columns and
clarified in the picture above].

- Implement the keyboard button ‘O’ so that the game spawns your enemy
implemented in the next phase enemy into a random unoccupied position in the
formation [has to be one of the spots not allowed to the bee enemy stated in the
comments in code].

• Phase 3: Implement additional Features:

- Make the current score appear at the top of the game screen, the score should rise by
a hundred whenever an enemy is killed.

- Update the high score whenever the new score is higher than the current high score.

- Implement the left and right bounds, the player ship should not be able to leave the
game screen.

- Make the enemy bee attack the player by flying towards him at random times.

- Create a new enemy, with a different sprite that also attacks the player, but this time
by shooting the player.

- Make both the enemy bee and your defined enemy spawn in the game at the start to
fill the formation allowed, your enemy should have different allowed places in the
formation, and when an enemy dies a random counter should start that decide when
the next enemy of that type will spawn.

### Creative Directions (Optional Ideas):
Each team’s Java Game Box: Galaga must be personalized, which means it must be different
from each other’s. Be as creative as possible. Remember that this project will become part of
your student project portfolio.
